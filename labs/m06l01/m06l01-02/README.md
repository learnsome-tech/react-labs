# m06l01-02 · Lane Scheduler

**Lesson:** [Concurrent Mode: Interruptible Work And Lane Priority](https://learnsome.tech/learn/react-course/m06l01) (lesson 6.1, module 6: React 19 Actions, Transitions And Async) · Pro  
**Check:** Graded

## Goal

You can explain how React Concurrent Mode uses Lane priority models to schedule, interrupt, and prioritize urgent user input over background work.

## Files

- [`starter/lane_scheduler.ts`](starter/lane_scheduler.ts): the listing from the lesson
- [`starter/run.sh`](starter/run.sh): the command the lesson ran
- [`starter/tsconfig.json`](starter/tsconfig.json)
- [`expected.txt`](expected.txt): the output the check compares with
- [`check.json`](check.json): how `./check` runs and checks this lab

## Steps

1. Go to the starter: `cd labs/m06l01/m06l01-02/starter`
2. Read `lane_scheduler.ts`.
3. Run it: `node lane_scheduler.ts`.
4. Check it from the repository root: `./check m06l01-02`.

## Expected output

```text
First: Sync
Second: Default
Remaining: 4
```

## How to check

`./check m06l01-02` copies `starter/` into a scratch directory and runs `node lane_scheduler.ts` there, the way the site's lab sandbox does: that directory is the working directory and `HOME`, `LANG=C.UTF-8`, `TZ=UTC`, a limit of 10 seconds and 256 KiB of output per stream.

It passes when the output matches `expected.txt` by the site's rules, within the limits. Standard output is compared line by line; spaces at the end of a line and blank lines at the end do not count. If that differs, standard output followed by standard error is compared with Python traceback frames and blank lines set aside, so a lesson that shows an error passes when your program prints the same error. A pass here is a pass on the site.
