# m02l01-02 · Vdom Diff

**Lesson:** [Virtual DOM vs Real DOM: The Reconciliation Cost Model](https://learnsome.tech/learn/react-course/m02l01) (lesson 2.1, module 2: Reconciliation Engine And The React Fiber) · Pro  
**Check:** Graded

## Goal

You can contrast Virtual DOM tree comparisons with real DOM layout costs and explain how React minimizes browser reflows.

## Files

- [`starter/run.sh`](starter/run.sh): the command the lesson ran
- [`starter/tsconfig.json`](starter/tsconfig.json)
- [`starter/vdom_diff.ts`](starter/vdom_diff.ts): the listing from the lesson
- [`expected.txt`](expected.txt): the output the check compares with
- [`check.json`](check.json): how `./check` runs and checks this lab

## Steps

1. Go to the starter: `cd labs/m02l01/m02l01-02/starter`
2. Read `vdom_diff.ts`.
3. Run it: `node vdom_diff.ts`.
4. Check it from the repository root: `./check m02l01-02`.

## Expected output

```text
Nodes compared: 2
Mutations required: 1
DOM Patch: Update text to "Beta"
```

## How to check

`./check m02l01-02` copies `starter/` into a scratch directory and runs `node vdom_diff.ts` there, the way the site's lab sandbox does: that directory is the working directory and `HOME`, `LANG=C.UTF-8`, `TZ=UTC`, a limit of 10 seconds and 256 KiB of output per stream.

It passes when the output matches `expected.txt` by the site's rules, within the limits. Standard output is compared line by line; spaces at the end of a line and blank lines at the end do not count. If that differs, standard output followed by standard error is compared with Python traceback frames and blank lines set aside, so a lesson that shows an error passes when your program prints the same error. A pass here is a pass on the site.
