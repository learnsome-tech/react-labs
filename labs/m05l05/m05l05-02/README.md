# m05l05-02 · Use Id Demo

**Lesson:** [useId: Generating Stable Accessible Form Element Identifiers](https://learnsome.tech/learn/react-course/m05l05) (lesson 5.5, module 5: Custom Hooks And Behavioral Abstractions) · Pro  
**Check:** Graded

## Goal

You can use useId to generate stable, collision-free identifiers for ARIA attributes and form labels that match between server and client hydration.

## Files

- [`starter/dom-shim.ts`](starter/dom-shim.ts)
- [`starter/run.sh`](starter/run.sh): the command the lesson ran
- [`starter/tsconfig.json`](starter/tsconfig.json)
- [`starter/use_id_demo.tsx`](starter/use_id_demo.tsx): the listing from the lesson
- [`expected.txt`](expected.txt): the output the check compares with
- [`check.json`](check.json): how `./check` runs and checks this lab

## Steps

1. Go to the starter: `cd labs/m05l05/m05l05-02/starter`
2. Read `use_id_demo.tsx`.
3. Run it: `tsx use_id_demo.tsx`.
4. Check it from the repository root: `./check m05l05-02`.

## Expected output

```text
Linked: true
```

## How to check

`./check m05l05-02` copies `starter/` into a scratch directory and runs `tsx use_id_demo.tsx` there, the way the site's lab sandbox does: that directory is the working directory and `HOME`, `LANG=C.UTF-8`, `TZ=UTC`, a limit of 10 seconds and 256 KiB of output per stream.

It passes when the output matches `expected.txt` by the site's rules, within the limits. Standard output is compared line by line; spaces at the end of a line and blank lines at the end do not count. If that differs, standard output followed by standard error is compared with Python traceback frames and blank lines set aside, so a lesson that shows an error passes when your program prints the same error. A pass here is a pass on the site.
