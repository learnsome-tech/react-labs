# m07l03-02 · Error Boundary

**Lesson:** [Error Boundaries: componentDidCatch And Fallback UI Trees](https://learnsome.tech/learn/react-course/m07l03) (lesson 7.3, module 7: Suspense, Streaming And Error Boundaries) · Pro  
**Check:** Graded

## Goal

You can implement Error Boundaries using static getDerivedStateFromError and componentDidCatch to isolate subtree crashes and display graceful fallbacks.

## Files

- [`starter/dom-shim.ts`](starter/dom-shim.ts)
- [`starter/error_boundary.tsx`](starter/error_boundary.tsx): the listing from the lesson
- [`starter/run.sh`](starter/run.sh): the command the lesson ran
- [`starter/tsconfig.json`](starter/tsconfig.json)
- [`expected.txt`](expected.txt): the output the check compares with
- [`check.json`](check.json): how `./check` runs and checks this lab

## Steps

1. Go to the starter: `cd labs/m07l03/m07l03-02/starter`
2. Read `error_boundary.tsx`.
3. Run it: `tsx error_boundary.tsx`.
4. Check it from the repository root: `./check m07l03-02`.

## Expected output

```text
Fallback: Handled
Active: true
```

## How to check

`./check m07l03-02` copies `starter/` into a scratch directory and runs `tsx error_boundary.tsx` there, the way the site's lab sandbox does: that directory is the working directory and `HOME`, `LANG=C.UTF-8`, `TZ=UTC`, a limit of 10 seconds and 256 KiB of output per stream.

It passes when the output matches `expected.txt` by the site's rules, within the limits. Standard output is compared line by line; spaces at the end of a line and blank lines at the end do not count. If that differs, standard output followed by standard error is compared with Python traceback frames and blank lines set aside, so a lesson that shows an error passes when your program prints the same error. A pass here is a pass on the site.
